## Tutorial

Checkout [Setup](#setup) section to configure plugin on your platform.

### Initialize the library

```dart
void main() {
  DartVLC.initialize();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Create a new Player

:::tip
It is a good idea to create `Player` instance as a class attribute where you can properly `dispose` & control it.
:::

```dart
final player = Player(id: 69420);
```

For passing VLC CLI arguments, use `commandlineArguments` argument.

```dart
final player = Player(
  id: 69420,
  commandlineArguments: ['--no-video'],
);
```

### Create a media for playback

:::warning
When playing a media from the assets, make sure to use the `Media.asset` constructor.
:::

```dart
Media.file(File('C:/music.mp3'));

Media.asset('assets/audio/example.mp3');

Media.network('https://www.example.com/music.aac');

// Clip [Media].
Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/music.aac',
  startTime: Duration(seconds: 20),
  stopTime: Duration(minute: 1),
);
```

### Create a list of medias using playlist

```dart
final playlist = Playlist(
  medias: [
    Media.file(File('C:/music.mp3')),
    Media.file(File('C:/audio.mp3')),
    Media.asset('assets/audio/example.mp3'),
    Media.network('https://www.example.com/music.aac'),
  ],
);
```

### Open a media or playlist into a player

```dart
player.open(
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
  autoStart: true, // Default
);
```

```dart
player.open(
  Playlist(
    medias: [
      Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
      Media.file(File('C:/music1.mp3')),
      Media.file(File('C:/music2.mp3')),
    ],
  ),
  autoStart: false,
);
```

### Control playback

```dart
player.play();

player.seek(Duration(seconds: 30));

player.pause();

player.playOrPause();

player.stop();
```

### Traverse through the playlist

```dart
player.next();

player.back();

player.jump(10);
```

### Manipulate an already playing playlist

```dart
player.add(
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.remove(4);

player.insert(
  2,
  Media.file(File('C:/music0.mp3')),
);

player.move(0, 4);
```

### Set playback volume & rate

```dart
player.setVolume(0.5);

player.setRate(1.25);
```

### Get & change playback device

```dart
List<Device> devices = Devices.all;

player.setDevice(devices[0]);
```

### Save the video snapshot

```dart
player.takeSnapshot(File('C:/save/the/screenshot/here.JPG'), 1920, 1080);
```

### Show the video inside widget tree.

Show `Video` in the `Widget` tree.

**NOTE:** This will cause additional CPU-load due to conversion of video frames to RGBA/BGRA pixel-buffers & `Texture` interop. For better performance, use [NativeVideo](#nativevideo) instead.

```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Video(
        player: player,
        height: 1920.0,
        width: 1080.0,
        scale: 1.0, // default
        showControls: false, // default
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

By default, `Video` widget's frame size will adapt to the currently playing video.
To override this & define custom video frame size, pass `videoDimensions` argument while instanciating `Player` class as follows.

```dart
Player player = Player(
  id: 69420,
  videoDimensions: const VideoDimensions(640, 360),
);
```

### NativeVideo

A more performant `Widget` for showing video inside the `Widget` tree.

This `Widget` is **more performant** compared to `Video` & uses [flutter_native_view](https://github.com/alexmercerind/flutter_native_view.git)
to embed the video output directly without any texture interop or pixel-buffer copy calls.

But, it is highly dependent on platform & other limitations apply. In general, this widget is more performant & should be used if possible.

1. Edit your `windows/runner/main.cpp` as required [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/flutter_native_view#setup).

2. Register the plugin with `useFlutterNativeView`.

```dart
void main() {
  DartVLC.initilize(useFlutterNativeView: true);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Pass `registerTexture` as `false` when creating `Player` & use `NativeVideo` widget.

```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  Player player = Player(id: 0, registerTexture: false);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: NativeVideo(
          player: player,
          height: 420.0,
          width: 320.0
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Thanks to [@tomassasovsky](https://github.com/tomassasovsky) for adding visual controls to `Video` widget.

### Change user agent

```dart
player.setUserAgent(userAgent);
```

### Retrieve metadata of media

```dart
final media = Media.network(
  'https://www.example.com/media.mp3',
  parse: true,
  timeout: Duration(seconds: 10),
);

Map<String, String> metas = media.metas;
```

### Listen to playback events

(Same can be retrieved directly from `Player` instance without having to rely on stream).

Listen to currently loaded media & playlist index changes.

```dart
player.currentStream.listen((CurrentState state) {
  state.index;
  state.media;
  state.medias;
  state.isPlaylist;
});
```

Listen to playback position & media duration.

```dart
player.positionStream.listen((PositionState state) {
  state.position;
  state.duration;
});
```

Listen to playback states.

```dart
player.playbackStream.listen((PlaybackState state) {
  state.isPlaying;
  state.isSeekable;
  state.isCompleted;
});
```

Listen to volume & rate of the `Player`.

```dart
player.generalStream.listen((GeneralState state) {
  state.volume;
  state.rate;
});
```

Listen to dimensions of currently playing `Video`.

```dart
player.videoDimensionsStream.listen((VideoDimensions video) {
  video.width;
  video.height;
});
```

Listen to buffering progress of the playing `Media`.

```dart
player.bufferingProgressStream.listen(
  (double event) {
    this.setState(() {
      this.bufferingProgress = event;
    });
  },
);
```

### Set an equalizer

Create using preset.

```dart
final equalizer = Equalizer.createMode(EqualizerMode.party);
player.setEqualizer(equalizer);
```

Create custom equalizer.

```dart
final equalizer = Equalizer.createEmpty();
equalizer.setPreAmp(10.0);
equalizer.setBandAmp(31.25, -10.0);
equalizer.setBandAmp(100.0, -10.0);
player.setEqualizer(equalizer);
```

Get equalizer state.

```dart
equalizer.preAmp;
equalizer.bandAmps;
```

### Broadcast a media

Broadcasting to localhost.

```dart
final broadcast = Broadcast.create(
  id: 0,
  media: Media.file(File('C:/video.mp4')),
  configuration: BroadcastConfiguration(
    access: 'http',
    mux: 'mpeg1',
    dst: '127.0.0.1:8080',
    vcodec: 'mp1v',
    vb: 1024,
    acodec: 'mpga',
    ab: 128,
  ),
);
broadcast.start();
```

Dispose the `Broadcast` instance to release resources.

```dart
broadcast.dispose();
```

### Record a media

Thanks to [@DomingoMG](https://github.com/DomingoMG) for adding `Record` and `Chromecast` classes.

```dart
final record = Record.create(
  id: 205,
  media: Media.network('https://www.example.com/streaming-media.MP3'),
  pathFile: '/home/alexmercerind/recording.MP3',
);
record.start();
```

## Setup

### Windows

Everything is already set up.

### macOS

To run on macOS, install CMake through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install cmake
```

If you encounter the error `cmake: command not found` during archiving:

1. Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and move it to the `Applications` Folder.
2. Run:

```bash
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
```

### Linux

For using this plugin on Linux, you must have [VLC](https://www.videolan.org) & [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) installed.

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install vlc
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
```

**On Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

```bash
sudo dnf install vlc
```

```bash
sudo dnf install vlc-devel
```

### iOS [WIP]

Disable bitcode generation for the whole project for MobileVLC to work.
Add the following to the `post_install` function living in the `Podfile` of your iOS Flutter project. For reference look at the `Podfile` in the example project.

```ruby
target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
end
```

For the example project to work you need to configure a real device in the xcode project, or comment out the build script `Build Device lib` in in `ios/dart_vlc.podspec`.

## Example

You can see an example project [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).

dart_vlc running on Ubuntu Linux.

## Workings

The repository contains a [C++ wrapper](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc) based on libVLC++. This makes handling of events and controls a lot easier & has additional features in it.
I preferred to do majority of handling in C++ itself, thus Dart code is minimal & very slight mapping to it.

This project might seem like a Flutter plugin, but it is based on FFI instead. [Here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/ffi) are the FFI bindings to [C++ wrapper](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/tree/master/dartvlc), which are shared by all platforms & same can be used in Dart CLI apps aswell.

## Vision

There aren't any media (audio or video) playback libraries for Flutter or Dart on Windows/Linux yet. So, this project is all about that.
As one might be already aware, VLC is one of the best media playback tools out there.

So, now you can use it to play audio or video files from Flutter or Dart apps.

As the project has grown, awesome people from community have added support for iOS & macOS aswell.
